16. Research Achievements and Results
-------------------------------------

.. (Write concisely in a way that can be easily understood by persons outside
   your field of specialization, 1 page)

**a. Alpine ice sheet**

* My primary field of research is paleo-ice sheet modelling
* Models that incorporate ice physics and use geological validation data
* My most recent publication is on the Alpine ice sheet
* The first complete pucture of the ice sheet through borders etc
* The ice sheet is more dynamic than previously thought
* The computations were performed on Piz Daint
* The results were reported by major media outlets in Switzerland and abroad
* Outreach materials are part of a permanent exhibition

**b. Bowdoin glacier**

* In 2015 and 2016 I have participated in two field campaigns
* I retrieved and analysed glacier borehole data
* I visited Hokkaido university for one year in 2018 -- 2019
* A first paper is in review

**c. Cordilleran ice sheet**

* My PhD thesis is about the Cordilleran ice sheet
* I applied PISM to paleoglaciology
* Due to complex climate high-resolution climate data is needed
* The ice sheet formed from numerous mountain ice fields
* Rapid retreat and ...

**d. Glacier melt parametrization**

* Day-to-day temperature variations significantly affect melt
* These are now implemented in PISM


17. List of Major Publications
------------------------------

.. (Authors (all), title, Journal,  Vol.　, No　, pp.   -   , Month, Year)
   (This list is to include your peer-reviewed papers that have been printed or
   are accepted for publication., 1 page)

18. Research plan in Japan
--------------------------

.. (follow plan below, 2 pages)

**a. Background of proposed research plan**

* Typically older glaciations evidence is overriden by the LGM
* The exception is east asia and alaska where MIS 4 > MIS 2
* Their glacial dynamics are understudied

**b. Purpose of proposed research**

* Fill the gap of knowledge of past glacier dyn in East vs West Arctic
* East Asia ice volume contribution to pre-LGM sea level drops

**c. Proposed plan**

* Apply for computing resources (CH/JP)
* Setup PISM for multiple domains in east Asia

**d. Expected results and impacts**

* A database of modelled glacier states
* An estimate of ice volume in ne asia through mis stages
* A framework for multidomain paleoglacier modelling


19. Your Academic Goals and Career Prospects after the Fellowship
-----------------------------------------------------------------

.. (ca. one third of a page)

* Spark interest of Japanese students
* Extend to asia, panarctic and global
* PMIP output
