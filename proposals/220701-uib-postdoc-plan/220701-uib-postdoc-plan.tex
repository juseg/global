    The intention of a postdoctoral research fellow position is, according to
    national regulations, to qualify the candidates to senior academic
    positions. In order to ensure a correct use of these positions, and to
    strengthen career development for postdoctoral research fellows, it is
    mandatory to draw up and submit a development plan within the first 3
    months of the employment period, ref.:
    \href{https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=no&u=https://lovdata.no/dokument/SF/forskrift/2006-01-31-102&prev=search&pto=aue}
    {Regulations on terms of employment for positions such as post-doctoral
    fellow, research fellow, research assistant and specialist candidate}.

    The development plan follows the requirements in
    ``\href{https://wiki.uib.no/matnat/images/a/a2/Retningslinjer_for_utviklingsplan_for_Postdoktorstillinger_ved_MN_fakultetet_UiB_-_10.05.-17.docx}

    research fellows}'') and reflects the organization of the post doctor period
    and the experiences and qualifications which are to be expected from the
    post doctor during the employment period.

\section{Project description for the research}

    \guideline{
        Planned scientific achievements (=objectives of the research project),
        planned achievements for scientific training (scientific skills). For
        externally financed positions (including RCN-funded projects), refer to
        the project description. The name of the project is given in the
        start-up form.  The project description must be attached to the
        development plan.}

    During my position at the University of Bergen (Apr. 2022 -- Mar. 2025), I
    plan to develop an open-source, automated framework for paleoglacier
    modelling applicable anywhere on Earth. This new tool will offer
    unprecedented accessibility to researchers from other disciplines (e.g.
    geology, ecology), allow for fully automated, consistent, multi-domain
    regional or global paleoglacier studies, and come along a companion
    outreach platform to improve communication on paleoglacier research beyond
    academia.

    This work is part of a broader four-year Trond Mohn Foundation (TMS) grant
    on the "past, present and future of alpine biomes worldwide". I contribute
    to work packages 1 (past) and 4 (outreach, see proposal) with mountain
    paleoglacier reconstructions, while two Ph.D. students planned to start in
    Jan. 2023 use my model output to inform their biome connectivity and
    biodiversity work within packages 2 (present) and 3 (future).

    Programming and academic writing have been part of my work and others' for
    over a decade. However, by the end of this project, I aim to be fluent in
    software development, documentation practices, and science communication.
    Besides, I am hoping that this project will pave the way to a more open and
    more efficient methods and data communication culture in paleoglaciology.

          \item[b.] Future career opportunities both inside and outside of
            academia need to be considered.
        \end{itemize}}

    I see this project as an opportunity to streamline my existing paleoglacier
    modelling workflow and extend its applications from selected regions (the
    Cordilleran ice sheet and the Alps) to a global, fully automated, and
    multi-domain setup. Within this project, I do not plan to expand on my
    less-acquired skills (e.g. field glaciology, remote sensing, teaching,
    low-level model development) but instead focus on what has been the most
    successful part of my academic CV so far (numerical modelling of
    paleoglaciers, software development and outreach). Through increased
    attention to code documentation and visualization I hope to get my work
    better noticed outside academia (museum content creators, geographic tech
    startups,  broader Python community). My ambition is that within three
    years, I will be able to provide academia and society with an automated,
    accessible tool that outlives my position here.

\guideline{
    Planning/development and implementation of research projects (e.g. a work
    package in a project)}

    Due to the interdisciplinary nature of our project, I expect a high degree
    of independence on my work. However, two Ph.D. students will be hired on
    the TMS grant from Jan. 2023, and depend on the availability and quality
    of my ice model output in order to inform their own biome connectivity and
    biodiversity modelling. We maintain regular communication between all
    project members and plan the following milestones on my work:

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Apr. 2023: technically valid ice model output, for a regional
        subset or lower resolution, that can be used by the Ph.D. students to
        develop their own workflow.
      \item Apr. 2024: scientifically valid output, publication-ready, that can
        be used by the Ph.D. students to prepare their own results.
      \item Apr. 2025: model output and methods shared in scientific
        publication, documented software, animations and interactive website.
    \end{itemize}

\section{Internationalization and network building}
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------

\guideline{
    Planned research stays abroad and other measures to increase national and
    international networks (attending conferences, hosting guest scientists
    etc.)}

    Networking with glacial geologists has been a continuous part of my work
    and remains critically needed here. Because glacial geology has
    traditionally been regional, our global project requires a global network.
    Later this year (29 Aug. - 2 Sep. 2022) we will invite two glacial
    geologists in Bergen to kick-off this network.

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Our new colleague Anna Hughes (University of Manchester, UK), as
        author of the latest reconstruction of Eurasian ice sheet, setting a
        new standard for ice-sheet reconstructions.
      \item My long-time colleague Martin Margold (Charles University, Czech
        Republic), who has conducted geological fieldwork and paleoglacier
        reconstructions in various parts of the world.
    \end{itemize}

    Besides this meeting, and my existing network of co-authors, I am regularly
    contacted by others interested in my data, software, and most often
    outreach work. I plan to continue these activities and expand to new
    regions, and hope to further attract new students and colleagues to work
    with me (and will make opportunity to work with them, see section 10).

    The broader TMS project has a large team of international collaborators,
    and further project meetings are planned where I will expand my network to
    biology, a completely new field for me, starting at the International
    Mountain Conference in Innsbruck (11-15 Sep. 2022). I am also part of the
    Bjerknes Centre, which offers ample opportunities to connect with local
    glaciologists, geologists and other climate scientists. Finally I am
    planning to attend relevant local and global conferences. That could
    include for instance the Nordic Geological Winter Meeting (4 – 6 Jan. 2023,
    Trondheim) or the International Union for Quaternary Research (14 – 20 July
    2023, Roma).

        May be addressed at a later date. Participation in future project

    We are still discussing when and where to apply for additional funds but
    most certainly plan to do so at some point. Ideas for a glacier-centric
    proposal I would lead include:

    \begin{itemize}
      \item assembling a global database of paleoglacier extent for more
        systematic model validation;
      \item expanding to all mountain ranges worldwide if that was not feasible
        within three years;
      \item expanding to small valley glaciers, perhaps better resolved by
        a flowline model such as the Open Global Glacier Model (OGGM); or
      \item expanding to continental ice sheets (i.e. Eurasian, North American
        and Antarctic), more challenging due to their longer response time and
        interaction with the ocean.

    \guideline{
        \begin{itemize}
          \item[a.] Expected scientific publication.

            relation to the scientific achievements, expected timing,
            suggestion for relevant publication channels etc.
        \end{itemize}}

    The results from paleoglacier modelling will be published for all mountain
    ranges worldwide, or at least as much as could be achieved, in a single
    publication planned for 2024. I anticipate that the global nature of the
    project will open the door to numerous sideline collaborations.

    I am regularly contacted with requests for collaborations on more regional
    paleoglacier modelling, and often turned down these requests due to other
    work (Greenland), lack of funding (2020-2022), and the time needed in
    setting up my modelling for another region. All of this is solved by my
    current position, where I will be able to dedicate all my work-time on
    paleoglaciers, with a global perspective, three-year job security, and
    develop the tools to fully automate regional model setup. One motivation
    for planning a single publication for now is to leave the door open for
    such collaborations and new publication ideas.


% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{11. Communication/dissemination}
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    \guideline{
        \begin{itemize}
          \item[a.] Planned measures to communicate research and its results to
            the interested public (newspaper articles, contributions to
            ``Climate Snack'', contributions to events such as open science
            days like ``forskningsdagene'').
          \item[b.] Training in presentation techniques, communications, etc.
        \end{itemize}}

    Besides academic publishing we plan the following output.

    \begin{itemize}
      \item The framework for multi-domain paleoglacier modelling will be
        continuously developed as the open-source, documented Python package
        "hyoga" (https://hyoga.readthedocs.io/), starting with the plotting
        interface, then input file preparation (topography and paleoclimate),
        and possibly a job wrapper (automatic job partitioning, queuing and
        restart on SLURM).
      \item An interactive website will allow users to explore modelling
        results in some sort of interactive way, such as zooming in and out on
        specific mountain ranges, and exploring their paleoglacier response to
        different temperature anomalies.
      \item I am a member of the Bjerknes Centre where I understand there is
        good support for communicating our results to the press, and
        potentially receive training to do so.
      \item I have been regularly contacted by museums and exhibitors, and hope
        this contact network will help us to get new work there too.
    \end{itemize}

\section{12. Leadership and innovation}
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    \guideline{
        \begin{itemize}
          \item[a.] Participation in boards and committees – scientific and
            administrative leadership
          \item[b.] Organizing scientific conferences/seminars
          \item[c.] Will the scientific work lead to innovation and attract
            interest beyond the actual project work?
        \end{itemize}}

    A most critical part of this project is the general sparsity and lack of
    organization of paleoglacier extent and dating data, which will be
    necessary to validate the model results. Regional reconstructions exist but
    rarely expand to more than a single ice sheet or mountain range. I believe
    this is currently a major barrier to progress in paleoglacier research, and
    hope that our efforts will provide upcoming generations of paleoglacier
    researchers with tools and inspiration to more systematically share and
    organize their data. Through outreach work, I hope to get as many people
    as possible excited in glacial geology, glaciers and biodiversity, and
    thereby invite them to explore and understand our world's changing nature.
